A theme specifically built for those who love tweaking their own themes. Open, clean and quick-loading design with a wide sidebar on the right. Options page offering a choice between a dark or light layout, caters for all the post formats and also offers user support via a support forum.

== Description ==

**What Tweaker4 is NOT**

This is not a theme where you click a few buttons in an options page thinking that this will magically cover all the customizations you could possibly require. With Tweaker4 you will have to get your hands dirty in the code when it comes to customization. Just like all the themes released by Tweaker Themes this one is aimed specifically at the WordPress user who wants to customize his/her theme. The theme itself is styled in such a way to make things as easy as possible to make your changes.

Tweaker4 does not contain all the bells and whistles with regards to functionality. These things, in my opinion, have no place in a theme, this functionality belongs in plugins and/or widgets.

**What Tweaker4 IS**

* Custom menus have been implemented.
* Custom headers can be set up from the back-end.
* Provision has also been made for custom backgrounds.
* Support for Post Formats has also been included.
* An options page has been included which allows the choice between a 'dark' and 'light' layout.
* The theme is translation ready.
* An Afrikaans version of the theme has been included in the package.
* The theme is ready for WP-PageNavi, all you need do is to activate the plugin.
* There are 4 widgetized areas, one in the sidebar and 3 just above the footer.
* The CSS used validates (except for the CSS3 bits).
* The XHTML used also validates as far as the WordPress core code allows it to.
* A wide content page template has been included which allows pages without a sidebar.
* On the main, search and archive pages the excerpts of the articles are shown if they exist. If there is no excerpt the normal content is shown up to the more-link. If no more-link has been added the full content will be shown. The user now has got full control of what is shown for each article.
* Support for the theme is available via a support forum.
